# AZZLE V2 onboarding for Bankr agents

Use this checklist before the first write in a session.

## 1. Detect the wallet and network

Ask Bankr for:

```text
what is my wallet address on Base?
what are my ETH, USDC, and AZL balances on Base?
```

Require Base mainnet (`chainId: 8453`) and enough ETH for gas.

## 2. Load and validate the deployment

Fetch:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dabus123/azzle/main/contracts/deployments/base-8453.json
```

Require:

- `version` is `2.0.0`
- `chainId` is `8453`
- requested write targets one of its lower-camel-case contract keys
- AZL is `external.azl`
- USDC is `external.usdc`

Stop if the manifest cannot be fetched or does not validate. Never fall back to
addresses from prior conversations.

## 3. Inspect current V2 collateral requirements

Read:

- `paymentGateway.intakePaused()`
- `pricingPolicy.quoteTask()`
- `depositVault.deposits(wallet)`
- `depositVault.reserved(wallet)`
- `depositVault.withdrawable(wallet)`
- `stakingVault.stakingActive()`
- `stakingVault.creditsOf(wallet)` only if staking is active

`quoteTask()` returns AZL-wei values for entry collateral, live-task reserve,
access fee, exit compensation, and protocol share. Values are oracle-derived
from `$25`, `$8`, `$5`, `$2.50`, and `$2.50` policy targets.

For a post or claim without an Action Credit, available collateral must cover
the current entry floor plus live-task reserve plus access fee. Do not estimate
this with a fixed AZL amount.

## 4. Fund the V2 deposit ledger if needed

The ledger holds AZL. Two supported intake paths exist:

### USDC intake

First require `paymentGateway.intakePaused() == false`. If intake is paused,
report that gateway onboarding is unavailable and do not submit the call.

1. Quote expected AZL output and select a nonzero `minAzlOut`.
2. Approve the exact USDC input to manifest `paymentGateway`.
3. Call `paymentGateway.fundWithUsdc(exactUsdcIn,minAzlOut,deadline)`.
4. Set `deadline` no more than ten minutes ahead.
5. Verify `depositVault.deposits(wallet)` increased.

### ETH intake

First require `paymentGateway.intakePaused() == false`. Then call
`paymentGateway.fundWithEth(minAzlOut,deadline)` with the exact ETH value and
verify the deposit balance increased.

The gateway may be paused. If so, report that intake is unavailable; do not
redirect funds to an arbitrary address.

## 5. Discover and inspect a task

```bash
./scripts/v2-tasks.sh open 20
./scripts/v2-tasks.sh task <taskId>
./scripts/v2-tasks.sh scope <taskId>
```

Confirm task state and parties immediately before a write. A blank public scope
means private discovery; request the scope from the poster through the agreed
private channel.

## 6. Execute with bounded approvals

### Post

Show the user:

- total budget in AZL and AZL wei
- deadline
- whether scope is public or private
- current oracle-priced collateral and fee quote
- target `taskRegistry`

After `post`, publish public scope through `taskScopeRegistry.publish` only if
the user selected open discovery.

### Claim

Require `POSTED`, confirm the caller is not the poster, and show the current
deposit quote. Claim does not fund task escrow.

### Fund

1. Require caller is poster and state is `CLAIMED` or `ACTIVE`.
2. Confirm funding remains within `totalAmount` and applicable deadlines.
3. Approve the exact AZL amount to manifest `escrowVault`.
4. Call `taskRegistry.fund(taskId,amount)`.
5. Full cumulative funding automatically changes `CLAIMED` to `ACTIVE`.

## 7. Delivery and settlement

Worker:

1. Share durable artifact and evidence references offchain.
2. Call `markDelivered(taskId)` before the task deadline.

Poster:

- call `release(taskId,amount)` for a partial payout, or
- call `complete(taskId)` to release all remaining funded AZL.

`markDelivered` does not transfer funds and does not change task state.
If the outcome is contested, a party may call `openDispute` with a nonzero hash
of durable evidence while the contract's dispute window permits it.

## Confirmation template

Before every write, present:

```text
Network: Base (8453)
Target: <manifest key> <address>
Method: <method>
Arguments: <decoded arguments>
Token/spender/amount: <when applicable>
Expected state change: <before> -> <after>
Irreversible effects: <fees, escrow movement, immutable scope, or evidence hash>
```

Proceed only after explicit confirmation of that specific action.
